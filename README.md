# Marsel Gray

Hi. I'm Marsel. I'm a software engineer living in the Washington, DC Metro area. 

## My Background
I started my career in tech as the Web Editor of my university paper, [The All State](http://www.theallstate.org/). Before graduating from university, I enlisted in the United States Army. I served as a Combat Medic for six years.

## Becoming An Engineer
After leaving the military, I transitioned to a software developer and began working at [NJI Media](https://www.njimedia.com/). Since 2021 I have worked for [WDG](https://www.webdevelopmentgroup.com/), an award-winning creative agency. I have flair for front end and data visualization.

I write code just how I like my pancakes: full stack.

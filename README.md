# Marsel Gray

Hi. I'm Marsel. I'm a software developer with over 5 years of professional experience. I don't like to define myself by the coding languages I've used. I define myself by the quality of the code I've written. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.

I started my career in development as the Online Editor of my university paper, [The All State](http://www.theallstate.org/). Before graduating from university, I enlisted in the United States Army. I served as a Combat Medic for six years. After leaving the military in 2017, I transitioned to a software developer. Since 2021 I have worked for [WDG](https://www.webdevelopmentgroup.com/), an award-winning creative agency.

# Marsel Gray

Hi. I'm Marsel. I'm a software engineer living in the Washington, DC Metro area. 

## My Background
I'm a software developer living in the Washington DC area. I started my career in development as the Online Editor of my university paper, [The All State](http://www.theallstate.org/). Before graduating from university, I enlisted in the United States Army. I served as a Combat Medic for six years.

## Becoming An Engineer
After leaving the military in 2017, I transitioned to a software developer. Since 2021 I have worked for [WDG](https://www.webdevelopmentgroup.com/), an award-winning creative agency. Prior companies include [NJI Media](https://www.njimedia.com/) and [the Bramer Group](https://bramergroup.com/).

I write code just how I like my pancakes: full stack.

# Marsel Gray

A solution-driven and detail-oriented developer with over 4 years of professional experience, I don't like to define myself by the coding languages I've used. I define myself by the quality of the code I've written. Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.

Advanced experience developing consumer-focused websites with an equal importance on front-end and back-end technologies. A self-sufficient employee who also knows the importance of teamwork and the power of reaching out to more experienced colleagues. Forward-thinking & willing to transfer knowledge as needed to contribute to the strength of the team.
